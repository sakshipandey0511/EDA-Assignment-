Zomato Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (eda-exploratory-data-analysis-2.ipynb)
Overview: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Zomato dataset using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

# Key Features:

1.Data cleaning, processing, and merging with country codes.

2.Visualizations such as pie charts and bar plots for aggregated insights (like rating distributions and country statistics).

3.Insights into restaurant trends, cost, delivery availability, and customer ratings.

4.Tech Stack: Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, Data Science Libraries.

# How to Run:

1.Download the notebook and the corresponding datasets (Country-Code.xlsx and Zomato CSV file).

2.Run in a Jupyter (Anaconda) environment or via Kaggle Notebooks.

3.Follow cell-by-cell for stepwise commentary and results.
Country Code Reference (Country-Code.xlsx)
Purpose: Supplementary file providing country code mappings for use in international datasets.

Usage: Can be integrated with restaurant or transactional datasets for global analytics.

Format: Excel sheet; columns include Country Code and Country.

# 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

1.Removed unnecessary columns

2.Handled missing values

3.Merged Country-Code.xlsx to map country names

4.Removed duplicate entries

5.Converted categorical data into meaningful labels


# 📈 Visualizations

1.The analysis includes multiple visualizations such as:

2.Top 10 countries with most restaurants

3.Most popular cuisines

4.Rating distributions

5.Average cost comparison by country

6.Heatmaps for correlation between numerical columns.

# 📊 Key Insights

Some highlights from the analysis include:

1.The countries with the most Zomato-listed restaurants

2.Popular cuisines and their average ratings

3.Relationship between cost and rating

4.Distribution of restaurant ratings across cities

5.Visual breakdown of online delivery and booking options


# 🚀 How to Use This Repo
1.Clone or download the specific project folders or notebooks you need.

2.Jupyter Notebooks are annotated for easy code-by-code navigation and include stepwise outputs and visualizations.

3.Supporting data files (Excel, CSV) are included where applicable.

4.Browse issues or discussions for troubleshooting tips and usage guidance.

# 🧠 Future Work

1.Build interactive dashboards using Plotly or Power BI
